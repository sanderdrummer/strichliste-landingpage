title: "Strichliste 2 released!"

After a lot of concept work, strichliste 2 has now a stable API and also a well designed front-end. We've also changed our
tech stack completely. Instead of node.js in the backend, and angular js in the front-end, we're now using a symfony based
PHP backend providing the API and also command-line tools for several tasks.

The new frontend is completely responsive and uses react and redux as it's core components.

New features of strichliste are:

* Send money between accounts
* Add transaction comments
* Undo-Function
* User editing
* Manage articles with Barcodes
* Buy articles by click or barcode scanner
* Several CLI commands like User-Cleanup, Strichliste1-Import, Retire Data, Edit Users
* Database independent

There are more features planned - from simple tools to UI improvements. Stay tuned

Best,
