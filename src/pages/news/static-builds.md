title: 'Static builds are now available!'
---

Now it's easier to setup your strichliste instance, because we now provide static builds for strichliste-web! You can easily grab the [latest build from github](https://github.com/hackerspace-bootstrap/strichliste-web/releases) and follow the [install instructions](/install/).

We're currently working on major features. Stay tuned for the next major release
